# Coding Quiz

This quiz utilizes Bootstrap page styling, a timer that begins on start, questions that subtract from the timer when they are incorrectly answered, a "high score" initial input that combines the time left and the user's initials and stores them in local storage, and a "view high scores" option that populates a dynamically created list from the array of scores pulled from local storage.
